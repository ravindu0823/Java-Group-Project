## About The Project
 A movie booking 
system is a software application that allows users to purchase tickets for movies at a cinema. The 
system typically includes a user interface that allows users to search for available showtimes, select 
seats, and complete the transaction using a credit card or other payment method. Some systems 
may also include features such as the ability to view trailers, read reviews, and reserve tickets in 
advance. The goal of a movie booking system is to make the process of buying movie tickets as 
convenient and efficient as possible for both the user and the cinema
